The class also has a number of\nsmall labs where students get to implement some of the language features\ndiscussed in class.\n\n\n\n\nSection ID:\n 927504\n\n\nLectures:\n Tuesday and Thursday, 6:30-7:50PM in CENTR 115\n\n\nSection:\n Fridays, 5:00-5:50PM in CENTR 119\n\n\nStaff email:\n \n\n\nPiazza:\n \nhttps://piazza.com/ucsd/winter2018/cse130\n\n\nGradescope code:\n MV8JVW\n\n\n\n\nTextbook\n\n\nWe will occasionally be following John Mitchell's \nConcepts In Programming\nLanguages\n textbook and assigning reading from this book and various other\nonline resources and papers.

The\ngoal of the course is to \n(1)\n familiarize you with various modern\nprogramming language concepts and paradigms and \n(2)\n get you to think about\nand understand the design trade-offs and implementations of different language\nfeatures. We will use real-world languages (e.g., JavaScript, Haskell, C++, and\nRust) to explore the different concepts. But, we will not cover any one\nlanguage in full -- this course is not meant to make you a proficient\nprogrammer, learning how to proficiently program in any of these languages is a\ncourse in and of itself.\n\n\nGrading\n\n\n\n\n5% Participation in class and online\n\n\n35% Homeworks and programming labs\n\n\n25% Midterm exam\n\n\n35% Final exam\n\n\n\n\nParticipation/pre-lecture readings\n\n\nBefore each class there will be some assigned reading. You are expected to do\nthe reading and have at least a vague understanding of the concepts that will\nbe discussed in class. This will allow us to spend the lecture time to solidify\nyour understanding.  Asking and answering questions in class, on Piazza, or\nduring office hours counts towards your class participation. \n\n\nHomework and programming labs\n\n\nWe will have written homework assignments and programming labs.  Both are meant\nto both reinforce your knowledge of the concepts covered in lecture and get you\nto think about PL in more depth, beyond what is covered lecture (e.g., if you\nwere tasked with designing a new language).\n\n\nYou are expected to work on written assignments in groups of 3. All written\nhomework must be typeset and submitted as a PDF using the online submission\ntool.  All written assignments must be submitted as a group.  Homeworks will be\nreleased Wednesdays and will be due the following Friday night (10 days). If\nyou turn it in early -- the following Wednesday (7 days) -- you will\nreceive an additional 10% of your grade. There are no late days.\n\n\nYou are expected to work on the programming labs by yourself. You may discuss\nthe assignments with students from the course, in general, but not any specific\nsolution. Programming assignments will be released Fridays and will be due 2\nweeks later on Friday night. There are no late days.\n\n\nIf you consult anything (books, academic papers, internet resources, people not\nin your group) when working on the assignments, note this in your submission.\nWe encourage outside learning but expect you to not seek out specific details\nabout a solution -- anything submitted should be considered your own work.\nSimilarly, you are expected to not publish or otherwise share your solutions at\nany point (even after the class is over).\n\n\nIf you are unsure about what is allowed, please ask the course staff.\n\n\nWe will have a 5 written homeworks and 5 programming labs. They equally count\ntowards 35% of your grade.\n\n\nTentative release dates for assignments\n\n\nAll assignments and solutions will be posted on Piazza. All are to be turned in\nvia gradescope. We will be releasing them on the following dates:\n\n\n\n\nWritten homeworks: Jan 17, Jan 24, Jan 31, Feb 14, Feb 20\n\n\nProgramming labs: Jan 12, Jan 26, Feb 09, Feb 23, Mar 09\n\n\n\n\nExams\n\n\nThe midterm exam will be held on \nFebruary 6th\n, in class. The midterm is\n\nclosed-book\n, but you may use a double-sided cheat sheet (letter-size).\n\n\nThe final exam will be held on March 20th in \nTBA\n from 7:00PM-9:59PM. You\n\nmust\n take the exam at this time and location.  The final is\n\nclosed-book\n, but you may use 2 double-sided cheat sheets (letter-size).\n\n\nThe exams will make up 60% of your grade. Since the final is cumulative your\nmidterm grade will be calculated as:\n\n\nmidterm \n 0 ?  max(final, midterm) : 0\n\n\n\n\n\nThis means that (1) you basically get a second chance if you don't so well on\nthe midterm and (2) you must show up to both the midterm and the final.
