### Recommended reading

If you have not worked with JavaScript before, take some time to familiarize
yourself with the basics of the language, as most of the labs in this class
will be in JavaScript.

We recommend the [Mozilla Developer Network's JavaScript
Guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide), but
there are many other tutorials on the Internet.

Dave Herman's [Effective JavaScript](http://effectivejs.com/) is very good
reference that covers a lot of the JavaScript intricacies.  You will not this
for the class, but if you end up writing JavaScript code in the outside world,
this book is must-read.
